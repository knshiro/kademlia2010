To make the program work:


1) Compile the JSON library: 
	go into json-c-0.9 folder
	type ./configure
	type make

2) To compile the program
	type make all in the root directory

3) Start the program
	DHT: ./kademlia <dhtport> <RPCport> <127.0.0.1/4200>
	      <dhtport>: port on which the DHT is going to communicate with other DHTs
   	      <RPCport>: port on which the DHT is going to communicate with the messaging application
	      <127.0.0.1/4200> : contact details of another DHT (that is connected to the network). 


	Messaging: ./messaging <MessagingPort> <RPCport> <DHTport> <login>
		   <MessagingPort> : port used to talk to other messaging applications (port stored into the DHT)
		   <RPCport> : port used to talk to the DHT
		   <DHTport> : port of the DHT to connect to
		   <login> : login.


4) What to type once it is started:
	DHT: 
	   print_routing_table
	   print_object_ids
	   ...
    
        Messaging App:
 	   To send a message to jack: "to:jack <message>"




5) Example:
        Start 2 DHTs and 2 messaging applications:

	./kademlia 4100 3100 127.0.0.1/4200
	./kademlia 4200 3200 127.0.0.1/4100
	
	./messaging 9200 8200 3100 jack
	./messaging 7200 6200 3200 joe
